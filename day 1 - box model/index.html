            <h3>kathak</h3>
            <p>Kathak is one of India's eight major classical dance forms, originating 
                in northern India, particularly Uttar Pradesh, and known for its rhythmic
                footwork, expressive storytelling, and graceful hand and eye movements. 
                The dance features distinct styles called gharana, with the Jaipur, Lucknow,
                and Banaras gharanas emphasizing different aspects like intricate footwork, 
                acting, or facial expressions, respectively. Kathak blends Hindu and Muslim 
                cultural influences, incorporating Persian elements, and is performed with 
                instruments such as the tabla and ghungroo bells. </p>
