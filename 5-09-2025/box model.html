            <h1> Music</h1>
            <p>Music is a universal art form that organizes sounds using rhythm, melody, and harmony to express feelings, tell stories, and bring people together. 
              It can be created and experienced through singing, playing instruments, dancing, and listening. Music has therapeutic benefits, improving memory, 
              focus, and communication, and serves as a fundamental part of human culture and history. It's often called a universal language because it transcends
              cultures and can communicate emotions without words.</p>

            <h1>Sports</h1>
            <p>Sport is generally recognised as system of activities based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity,
               with major competitions admitting only sports meeting this definition. Some organisations, such as the
               Council of Europe, preclude activities without any physical element from classification as sports.</p>

            <h1>Nature</h1>
            <p>Nature is all around usâ€”trees, water, air, and land. It gives us food, shelter,
               and fresh air to breathe. Flowers, birds, and animals make nature beautiful. 
               We must keep nature clean and safe. Throw waste in dustbins, not on the road.</p>
